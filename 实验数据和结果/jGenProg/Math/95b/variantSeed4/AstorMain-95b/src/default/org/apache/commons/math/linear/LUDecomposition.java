/**
 * An interface to classes that implement an algorithm to calculate the 
 * LU-decomposition of a real matrix.
 * <p>The LU-decomposition of matrix A is a set of three matrices: P, L and U
 * such that P&times;A = L&times;U. P is a rows permutation matrix that is used
 * to rearrange the rows of A before so that it can be decomposed. L is a lower
 * triangular matrix with unit diagonal terms and U is an upper triangular matrix.</p>
 * <p>This interface is based on the class with similar name from the now defunct
 * <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA</a> library, with the
 * following changes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>several signatures have been added for the <code>solve</code> methods (in the superinterface),</code>
 *   <li>a <code>decompose</code> method has been added (in the superinterface),</code>
 *   <li>the <code>det</code> method has been renamed as {@link #getDeterminant() getDeterminant}.</li>
 * </ul>
